## Description
**Project Title:** User Management using Express, Mongoose, Needle, and MongoDB compass<br/>
    Create a simple user management using Express, Mongoose, Needle, and MongoDB compass.<br/>
**Author: Dalton Ken D. Cadsawan**<br/><br/>
**Code Description:**<br/>
    This integrates functions of saving, updating, finding, and deleting of student members in a MongoDB database. The code makes use of an index file that has a router, controller, and a test file.<br/>
## HOW TO USE:<br/>
- *First:* Create a database in MongoDB that has the name StudentDatabase and collection studentData
- *In adding data:* In adding and saving data to the database you may add or change the students array in the test.js file but make sure to follow the format. NOTE: the current array every run will be added.
- *In finding user:* Just change the stdnum in the getrequest line of the test.js file.
- *In updating fname and lname:* Just change the newFname and newLname in the test files getrequest. But type in the first name of the student to be updated.
- *In deleting a member:* Change the stdnum in the testfile request line.
- *Members & Delete All:* This works as expected no need to change any values
- *Finally:* If you want to see changes in the MongoDB database while running, you may comment out the delete all getrequest. So, that you can see changes in real time in the database upon running
